    - Show terminal: `docker compose up -d` (Postgres started).
    - Show terminal: `npm run seed` (Seeding 300 students, 30 companies).
    - Show terminal: `npm run dev` (App running on port 3000).

2.  **Landing Page & Profile Building**
    - Open `http://localhost:3000`.
    - Highlight the Glassmorphism UI and "Build Your Intern Profile" step.

    - **Action**: Enter "3" Projects and "8.8" CGPA.
    - Click **"Calculate Market Readiness"**.

3.  **Simulation & Real-time Adjustment**
    - **Observation**: Dashboard appears. Show "Market Readiness Score" and "Acceptance Chance".
    - **Feature**: "Live Simulation Engine".
    - **Action**: Click "What if +1?" on "System Design" skill.
    - **Observation**: Watch the Probability score increase instantly (React state update + Algorithm re-calc).
    - **Feature**: "Export Report". Click and show the PDF download.
