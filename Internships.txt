Zarle Infotech is hiring a Software Engineer to join an international SaaS project in the retail-tech space, working on a live production platform used by large global retail and FMCG brands. This is a hands-on engineering role where data accuracy, system reliability, and edge-case handling are critical, as the platform replaces manual, spreadsheet-driven workflows by ingesting structured enterprise data, transforming it into retailer-specific formats, validating complex business rules, and automating submission and tracking of promotional campaigns. The system directly impacts real products in real markets—when it works, promotions run smoothly across stores; when it doesn’t, pricing errors occur—making precision essential. Strong English communication is required, as the role involves regular collaboration with international teams on a backend-heavy, data-driven system designed to streamline thousands of retailer campaigns efficiently and reliably. 1. Design and implement backend APIs to process structured data and enforce business rules. 2. Build and maintain data transformation logic that converts raw inputs into validated, structured formats. 3. Debug and resolve production issues related to data accuracy, performance, or system reliability. 4. Identify and fix bugs related to data accuracy, performance, or system behavior. 5. Participate in code reviews and follow clean coding practices. 6. Work closely with senior engineers and stakeholders to understand requirements and implement solutions. 7. Ensure proper testing of edge cases before deployment. 8. Contribute to deployment and infrastructure improvements when required.

Better works on real products at different stages of existence. Some are built for companies launching new initiatives. Some are ideas we are exploring ourselves. In both cases the job is the same: turn unclear ideas into working software people can actually use — quickly. AI makes writing code faster. Your role is to make sure what gets built is usable, understandable, and evolves with real feedback. 1. Build usable products end-to-end (backend, frontend, integrations) 2. Convert vague requirements into concrete behavior 3. Ship early versions in days, then iterate based on usage 4. Use AI tools daily to accelerate development while keeping code understandable 5. Talk to users or stakeholders to clarify behavior 6. Fix problems discovered after real usage, not just before release 7. Simplify systems so future changes remain easy 8. Work in a small team with short development cycles and real user feedback. 9. Start tasks without full specifications and make independent decisions. 10. Replace recently written code when needed and prioritize learning speed over code volume. 11. Focus on working software rather than perfect architecture at the beginning. 12. Build complete products instead of isolated tickets. 13. Stay comfortable with ambiguity and prefer shipping over polishing. 14. Learn new tools quickly and use AI as a collaborator, not a shortcut. 15. Prioritize user behavior over technical elegance. 16. Generate drafts with AI, verify and refine outputs, and keep systems understandable for humans. 17. Know when to trust AI and when to rewrite, balancing speed with clarity. 18. Work with Python (FastAPI/Flask) and React with TypeScript. 19. Value problem-solving ability over stack familiarity. 20. Build real products quickly and learn from real-world usage rather than planning documents.
